           | My name is Joe and I am a London-based Junior JavaScript Developer. I started learning Web Development a few years ago now and I have
           | a diverse set of skills ranging from design to development. I have a good eye for beautiful and clean design, but my one true love is JavaScript.
           | I love JavaScript and everything that comes with it, from the client-side to the server-side of the language, my appreciation to Javascript keeps growing day by day.
